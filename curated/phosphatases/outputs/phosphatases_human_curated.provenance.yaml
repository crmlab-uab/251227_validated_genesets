notes:
  - Comprehensive phosphatase list covering all substrate types
  - Substrate columns are not mutually exclusive (e.g., PTEN is both protein and lipid)
  - Regulatory subunits included because they determine substrate specificity
  - Some genes appear in multiple HGNC groups and are listed once with combined groups
  - PP1 regulatory subunits (179 genes) are the largest group, reflecting PP1's broad role
  - Filter on Substrate_protein=Y to get protein phosphatases only
  - Filter on Is_catalytic=Y to get only the enzymatically active phosphatases
