\title{Load MSigDB GMT files (simple loader)}
\usage{
load_msigdb(collection = "H", species = "Hs", cache_dir = "inst/gmt")
}
\arguments{
\item{collection}{Character vector of MSigDB collections (e.g. "H", "C2").}

\item{species}{Character, species code suffix used in filenames (e.g. "Hs", "Mm").}

\item{cache_dir}{Character path to store downloaded GMTs. Defaults to "inst/gmt".}
}
\value{
A named list where each element is a character vector of gene symbols.
}
\description{
Download (if missing) and load MSigDB GMT files into R as a named list of
character vectors. This is a lightweight helper intended for small-scale
integration tests and pipelines.
}
\details{
The function constructs a filename using the convention used by MSigDB
release GMT files (example: `mh.all.v2024.1.Hs.symbols.gmt`). If the file is
missing it will attempt an HTTP GET to the canonical GSEA URL and write the
file to `cache_dir`. Download attempts are wrapped in `try(..., silent=TRUE)`
so callers can rely on graceful failure (an empty list) when network access is
unavailable.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
  # load local cached collection (if present)
  load_msigdb("H", "Hs", cache_dir = tempdir())
}
